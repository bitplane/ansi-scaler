# ANSI Scaler

ANSI Scaler builds reproducible synthetic training corpora for ANSI-art scaling.
The current pipeline creates isolated cartoon game assets and progressively
simplified image LODs:

```text
scene-kit catalogue -> prompts -> Sana raster -> rembg cutout -> VTracer LODs
```

## Setup

The project uses `uv`, a committed dependency lock, and Make installation
stamps. Run:

```bash
make dev
make test
make help
```

`make clean` never removes corpus data.

## Running the corpus

Validate and build prompts without downloading a model:

```bash
make catalog
make prompts
```

Run ten real records through every stage:

```bash
make smoke
```

This downloads the pinned Sana and rembg models and requires a CUDA GPU. The
initial 1,200-image run is resumable:

```bash
make corpus
```

Choose another recipe with `RUN_CONFIG=configs/runs/example.yaml`. Generated
manifests, reports, and content-addressed artifacts live under ignored `data/`.
Each stage records failures separately and skips completed output IDs when
resumed.

## Catalogue

Canonical reusable identities live in `catalog/concepts`; scene kits select
and contextualise them in `catalog/scene-kits`. Prompts are disposable derived
data, never catalogue source. The first catalogue contains woodland, village,
city, castle, and spaceport kits with 24 memberships each.

The LOD stage retains the transparent original plus canonical SVGs and small
PNG previews. Intended terminal-width selection is:

```text
0-9 cells    LOD 3
10-39 cells  LOD 2
40-79 cells  LOD 1
80+ cells    original cutout
```
